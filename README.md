# answer-deepki


## Description
This repository is a technical assessment for the Deepki Data Engineer role. For this test, I am not just trying to solve the problem but also aiming to show my coding style. It is also an opportunity for me to receive constructive feedback on what could be improved if a future collaboration is possible.

When you run the application, it will generate two outputs:

  1. The Plus Code of the closest building, shown in the terminal.
  2. A plot saved as output.png.

## Pr√©requis
- Docker should be running on your environment.

## Installation
Clone the repo Git :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharlesDouxPro/answer-deepki.git
cd answer-deepki'''
